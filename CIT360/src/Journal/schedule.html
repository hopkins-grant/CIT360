			<h2>Stay on a Schedule</h2>
				<p>I have always been a schedule averse person. Generally speaking I like to do things when I have energy and willpower for it. That almost never coincides with some sort of a schedule.</p>
				<p>However through this semester I have learned that when it comes to getting tough things done, a schedule is invaluable to managing that time and effort. My current work ethic has me not doing anything for longs periods of time and then working for countless hours all at once. Things are done in a burst rather than consistently. I came to understand that in a team setting this is not an effective method. Working in short bursts leaves lots of room for last minute devastating issues. It also burns me out much faster.</p>
