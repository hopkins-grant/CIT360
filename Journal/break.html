			<h2>Break It Apart</h2>
				<p>A profound Meta-Cognition moment I had this semester was after I received back my scores on my first batch of programs that I submitted for review. I was quite panicked at the start of this course and was lost in its structure as well as concerned with my coding abilities. Once I received back passing grades on all of my topics I realized that this large task was possible by breaking everything down into smaller pieces. I was worried because I was thinking that I would have to learn everything all at once. However, if you break a large task into smaller pieces it becomes entirely manageable. I think this lesson will be really crucial to my future learning.</p>
