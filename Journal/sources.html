			<h2>Find Good Sources</h2>
				<p>Something I frequently struggled with in the beginning was finding where to go to get the information I need. I floundered a lot at the beggining and wasted a lot of time looking for the appropriate information.</p>
				<p>When I finally gave in and turned to the textbook of the course I found that things became a great deal easier. By also tapping into my teammates experiences I was also able to make my work much easier.</p>
				<p>Good sources for information are a huge deal in learning new things. If you can tap into someone who has been through it, or made it, things become much easier.</p>
