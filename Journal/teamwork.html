			<h2>Teamwork</h2>
				<p>I learned that value of working in a team on hard things this semester. There were a great many times when I found myself extremely frustrated about how long it was taking me to do many of the assignments. I came to understand, however, that working in a team is all about covering each other's weaknesses. As soon as I started taking my team seriously and allowing them to help things became much easier. Many times in the past I have regraded group work as inefficient and something that produces sub par things. However, I have come to learn when it comes to tackling large projects on difficult endeavors, teams can increase productivity by a great deal.</p>
